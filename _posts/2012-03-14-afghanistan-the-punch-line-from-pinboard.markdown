Tens of thousands of supposedly civilized Americans think the senseless
slaughter of sixteen men, women, and children was a good start. Their comments
fill the halls of America and litter the airwaves and the internet and they
don’t even have the common decency to be ashamed. The murderous clamor of the
ignorant and foolish and the brutally stupid fouls our national discourse and
stains our national soul. I’ll say in complete honesty that I truly hope that
their God does indeed exist and that one day these fuckers will stand before
His righteous wrath and be judged.
