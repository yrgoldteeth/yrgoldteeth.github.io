We can glimpse, glance, visualize, view, look, spy, or ogle. Stare,
gawk, or gape. Peek, watch, or scrutinize. Each word suggests some
subtly different quality: looking implies volition; spying suggests
furtiveness; gawking carries an element of social judgment and a sense
of surprise. When we try to describe an act of vision, we consider a
constellation of available meanings. But if thoughts and words exist on
different planes, then expression must always be an act of compromise.
