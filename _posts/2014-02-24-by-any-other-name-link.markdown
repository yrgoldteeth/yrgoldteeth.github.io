The old scribe was asked why, in his official accounts, the temples and the clans were named but the many monks and priests were not.

“If I gave you a sheet of figures to tally, would you first bestow a name upon each number seven?” asked the scribe, dismissing the questioner with a wave of an ink-stained hand.

This was mentioned to the Java master, who nodded and finished his tea.

The next morning the scribe ascended to his office, only to find the following written in thick block letters above the door:

`public static final int NUM_DAYS_IN_WEEK =`

At this, the old scribe Qi was enlightened.
