But the game is rigged. I know this because I loved my craft for many
years and it meant nothing to anyone save my mother, my father, my
siblings, my wife and a few close friends. Then one man of some
privilege spoke to another man of some privilege and I became a man of
some privilege with megaphone, which I now employ, across an ocean, to
bring these thoughts to you. And I love both of these men of
privilege--power is a fact, it is not morality. Losing is tragic, but it
is not noble. How many freedom fighters turned despots in the possession
of superior guns?
