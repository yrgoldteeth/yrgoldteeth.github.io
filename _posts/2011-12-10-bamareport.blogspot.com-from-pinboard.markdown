Too many people compare college football to the NFL, but a more accurate analog can be found in another lucrative cartel: the Mexican drug trade. The SEC, like Juarez, may be the focal point of a lot of the action, but even beyond its dominant rep, the game is on all over.
  
  
I heard of a mountaintop village, far from the US border, that one cartel used as a vacation spot. Another town on the Gulf served as a narco retirement village. The point being that weirder normal gets, the more normal weird seems. And that is where we are with college football: we are in deep weird.
