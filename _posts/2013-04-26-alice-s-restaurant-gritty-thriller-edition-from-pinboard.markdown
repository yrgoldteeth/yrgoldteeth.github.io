ARLO sitting in a holding cell. BIG UGLY approaches, heavy danger vibes,
this is a bad scene. He stares right down at ARLO, pops knuckles, and
says: “what are you in for?” 

Arlo stares right back at him, all intensity. Cut over to super-fast
montage of ARLO fighting a guy, ARLO killing the guy, ARLO chucking the
guy over a cliff, body falling among a pile of trash. 

Cut back to ARLO staring up at BIG UGLY. Deadpan response: “littering”.
