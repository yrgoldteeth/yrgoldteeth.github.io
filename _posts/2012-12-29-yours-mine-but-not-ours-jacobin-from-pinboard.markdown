Because the rhetoric of security is one of universality and neutrality
while the reality is one of conflict and division, state officials and
elites have every motivation, and justification, to suppress heterodox
and dissenting definitions of security. And so they have, as Hobbes
predicted they could and would. But because a neutral, universal
definition of security is impossible to achieve in practice, repression
for the sake of security must be necessarily selective: only certain
groups or certain kinds of dissent will be targeted. The question then
becomes: which groups, which dissent?

Because government officials are themselves connected with particular
constituencies in society — often the most powerful — they will seldom
suppress challenges to security that come from the powerful; instead
they will target the powerless and the marginal, particularly if the
powerless are mobilizing to threaten the powerful. So the US government
during WWI made it illegal to urge people, like the Socialists, not to
buy war bonds — but it did allow a Wall Street adviser to counsel his
client not to make a bad investment.
